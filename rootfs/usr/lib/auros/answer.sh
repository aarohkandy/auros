#  answer.sh — the four things the desktop may ask for as root
#
#  Started by auros-answer.path when a file appears in /run/auros,
#  which is aurshell.service's own RuntimeDirectory: mode 0700, owned
#  by the person using the machine.
#
#  ROOT DOES NOT OPEN A PATH SHE OWNS. That is the whole shape of this
#  script and it is the second attempt at it. The first one read the
#  request with `head -c 64 "$REQ"` and wrote its answer, its log and
#  its report through `$RUN/...` -- as root, through names she
#  controls, with nothing to stop any of them being a symbolic link. An
#  adversarial review reproduced truncate-anything, append-anything and
#  chmod-anything from one request, and a read oracle for root-only
#  files from another. That is a local root escalation, on every built
#  image, reachable by anything running as her.
#
#  So:
#
#    reading  the request is taken by `aurfirst request`, in C, with
#             O_NOFOLLOW and an fstat on the descriptor it reads from
#             -- not a stat on the name, which is a race she wins. See
#             src/aurfirst/request.c.
#    writing  everything goes into /run/auros-answer, which is THIS
#             service's own RuntimeDirectory: root-owned, mode 0755,
#             world-readable. The desktop reads from there and cannot
#             put anything in it.
#
#  The word is still not a command. It is matched against a fixed list
#  of four and anything else is written down as unknown.
