/* plat_win.c — the real one. See plat.h.
 *
 * NOT TESTED ON THIS MACHINE AND CANNOT BE. There is no Windows here
 * and wine does not implement raw physical-drive handles, volume
 * dismount, or firmware variables. What IS tested is everything above
 * this line: the phase engine runs whole against plat_sim.c, and the
 * bytes it produces are checked against the programs that read them.
 * This file is the part that has to be right on the first machine it
 * meets, so it is written to be read rather than to be clever, and
 * every call that has a failure mode worth naming names it.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS WINDOWS MAKES HARDER THAN THEY LOOK
 *
 *   A raw handle to a disk that has mounted volumes on it will accept
 *   writes and then have them thrown away, or fail with ERROR_ACCESS_
 *   DENIED depending on the version. The documented way is to lock and
 *   dismount every volume on the disk first, and to keep those handles
 *   open for as long as the writes last. So take_stick() opens them
 *   and give_stick() closes them, and nothing writes in between
 *   without having gone through the first.
 *
 *   Reads and writes must be whole sectors at sector-aligned offsets.
 *   Every caller here already works in whole megabytes, but "already"
 *   is not a guarantee, so the tail of an unaligned write is done by
 *   reading the sector, changing part of it, and writing it back.
 *
 *   SetFirmwareEnvironmentVariableExW needs SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege,
 *   which is present but DISABLED in an elevated token. Not enabling it
 *   gives ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD on every machine, which reads like
 *   "you are not an administrator" and is not.
