/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  AurBridge wizard — the face of the only component of AurOS that can
 *  destroy a stranger's data.
 *
 *  Everything here is owner-drawn: there is not a single Win32 control
 *  in this program. A grey system button in the middle of the Nocturne
 *  palette reads as "unfinished software", and a user who does not trust
 *  the installer is a user who clicks through the disclosure without
 *  reading it. The look is load-bearing.
 *
 *  NOTHING IN THIS FILE OPENS A HANDLE, and none should ever be added.
 *  The work is in phases.c, behind plat.h, on a worker thread. That is
 *  not tidiness: this file's code runs on the UI thread, so anything
 *  that blocks stops the window painting, and a wizard that appears to
 *  have crashed in the middle of preparing somebody's disk is the
 *  worst thing this program can do short of losing her files.
 *
 *  Before the restart, everything AurBridge has done is undoable, and
 *  closing the window undoes it — see install_cancel().
 *
 *  Safety invariants enforced in code, not just in pixels:
 *    - nav_allowed() refuses every page from the backup gate onward
 *      unless preflight has completed with zero PF_BLOCK results. The
 *      BLOCKED page has no continue affordance, and even if one were
 *      added by accident, nav_allowed() would refuse it.
 *    - "Start installing" re-runs preflight before the phase list is
 *      touched (AURBRIDGE.md: destructive subcommands re-run preflight
 *      and abort on any block).
 *
 *  Build:
 *    x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu11 -mwindows \
 *      -o aurbridge-wizard.exe wizard.c preflight.c -lgdi32 -lcomctl32

 *     upsides is useless for choosing", so `tradeoff` is never empty and
 *     is drawn at the same size and weight as `best_for`.
 *   - No other operating system, desktop or device brand is named
 *     anywhere. Describe the behaviour instead: "a bar along the bottom
 *     listing everything you have open".
 *   - Workbench is the only one allowed to require learning, and says so
 *     in those words so nobody picks it by accident.
 * Order is by how likely each is to be the right answer for the person
 * this installer exists for; the one that demands study comes last. */

 *  never chosen a desktop before and does not know the words for any of
 *  this — so the page is built out of pictures and tradeoffs, not names.
 *
 *  Three rules it is written to, all from that document:
 *    - Every card states its downside as loudly as its upside. The two
 *      strips are the same size, the same weight and the same colour of
 *      text; only the label differs.
 *    - Nothing here names another operating system, desktop or device.
 *      The behaviour is described instead.
 *    - Rail is preselected, because it is the only one in which a thing
 *      cannot be hidden; Workbench is marked as requiring learning, in
 *      those words, so nobody arrives at it by accident.

 * hardware this installer runs on; and it is the same face the website
 * uses, so the thing a person downloads looks like the page they
 * downloaded it from. Segoe UI stays for text, where its job is to
 * disappear.
 *
 * The weights are deliberately uneven: the serif carries its emphasis
 * through SIZE at weight 400, and the sans carries its through WEIGHT
 * at a small size. Big-and-quiet against small-and-loud is contrast
 * that one face at 600/620/650 cannot produce. */
