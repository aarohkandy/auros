/* plat.h — everything AurBridge does that touches the world.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A LAYER HERE AT ALL, when the whole program only ever
 * runs on Windows.
 *
 * The phase engine is the half of this product that decides what
 * happens to a stranger's disk before the restart. It cannot be tested
 * on the machine it is written on: there is no Windows here, wine does
 * not do raw disk handles or EFI variables, and the one thing that
 * must never be done to test it is to run it against a real computer
 * and see.
 *
 * So every call that leaves the program goes through this header, and
 * there are two implementations of it:
 *
 *   plat_win.c  the real one: CreateFileW on \\.\PhysicalDriveN,
 *               DeviceIoControl, SetFirmwareEnvironmentVariableExW,
 *               mountvol for the EFI partition.
 *   plat_sim.c  a machine made of ordinary files -- a directory with
 *               disk0.img, disk1.img, an esp/ tree and an efivars
 *               file. Built with the HOST compiler and never shipped,
 *               so the phase engine can be run end to end against the
 *               same synthetic machine tools/machine.sh gives the
 *               staging environment -- and the stick it produces is
 *               then the stick the installer is tested with.
 *
 *               It used to say "builds for Linux as well as for
 *               Windows", and it does not any more: its plat_fetch is
 *               a socket client behind #ifndef _WIN32, so a Windows
 *               link of it fails on an undefined symbol. Nothing
 *               builds it that way and nothing should -- build/aurbridge
 *               refuses to put the simulated platform into a shipped
 *               binary at all -- but a header that describes a
 *               property the tree does not have is a header somebody
 *               will rely on.
 *
 * That last sentence is the whole point. Before this, the test's
 * memory stick and journal were written by a python heredoc that
 * agreed with aurstage because both were written by the same person on
 * the same afternoon. Now the thing under test writes them.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT BEHIND THIS LINE: anything destructive to the machine's
 * own disk. AurBridge never writes to it. Phases 0 to 3 write to the
 * memory stick, to files on the EFI partition, and to two firmware
 * variables, and that is the complete list -- which is why
 * plat_disk_write() refuses any disk that is not the nominated stick.
