/* wr.h — the only place in this directory that writes to a disk.
 *
 * Stages A and B write nothing, and build/staging enforces that by
 * refusing to build an image if anything under src/aurstage/ opens a
 * device writably. Stage C has to write. This file is the exception,
 * and it is ONE file so that the gate can stay a gate: everything else
 * remains provably read-only, and the whole of the destructive
 * surface is in one place a person can read in an afternoon.
 *
 * NAMED WINDOWS, NOT ONE RANGE
 *
 * The first design had a single byte range and a single armed flag.
 * An adversarial review pointed out that the GPT commit cannot be
 * expressed in it -- the backup header is at the end of the disk, the
 * primary is at LBA 1, and neither is inside the root extent -- so the
 * one function the header said existed "for the GPT commit" could
 * never be called successfully. The natural repair under deadline is
 * to widen the range or add a bypass flag, and that is exactly the
 * property the file exists to hold.
 *
 * So the windows are disjoint, each with a purpose in its name,
 * all decided in one place. A write names the window it belongs
 * to. Widening one to make a write fit is then a change somebody has
 * to defend, not a flag somebody sets.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, said plainly because a reader will assume
 * otherwise: writes the kernel makes on our behalf. A mount(2) is
 * invisible to it, and so is anything a program we exec does.
 *
 * That paragraph used to end by promising an `espfix` that would mount
 * the machine's EFI partition read-write and read its own writes back
 * by hand. There is no such file and there will not be one. R12 says
 * that partition is never mounted, and loader.c is what replaced the
 * idea: AurOS is started from an EFI System partition of its own,
 * written through THIS file like everything else, so the boot chain is
 * inside the gate rather than beside it.
 *
 * EFI VARIABLES ARE THE ONE THING GENUINELY OUTSIDE IT, and they have
 * a gate of their own: nvram.c, named in build/staging the way this
 * file is, with four checks of its own. See nvram.h.
