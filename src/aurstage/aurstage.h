/* aurstage.h — the staging environment.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *
 * The one restart in this product lands here, not in Windows and not
 * in the installed system. This is the AurOS initramfs, running as PID
 * 1, in the same boot that will end inside AurOS. It is where every
 * destructive step happens, because it is the only place on the
 * machine where recovery code can run while the disk is being
 * rearranged. docs/AURBRIDGE.md has the reasoning; the short form is
 * that Windows' online shrink cannot move pagefile.sys, so shrinking
 * from inside Windows costs a second restart -- the one thing the
 * whole design is spending its budget to avoid.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * It is not systemd and it will not become systemd. A generator, a
 * unit with an Install section, or an automount that mounts the
 * Windows volume behind our back is the single thing this environment
 * must never do: ntfsresize refuses a mounted volume, and a volume
 * mounted read-write for even a moment is a volume whose journal we
 * have changed. Nothing here mounts anything it was not told to.
 *
 * THE STAGES, and this file only implements the first
 *
 *   A  it exists, it boots, it writes NOTHING, and it hands over to
 *      the installed system in the same boot.          <- this file
 *   B  read-only verification: the journal AurBridge left, the NTFS
 *      state, `ntfsresize --no-action`, a surface test. Then a
 *      --dry-run that reboots back to Windows having changed nothing.
 *      docs/AURBRIDGE.md calls that the first shippable artifact.
 *   C  the destructive steps, one at a time, each with its own
 *      kill-the-power test.
 *   D  the way back: recovery partition, "put Windows back".
 *
 * "Nothing from a later stage before an earlier one" is the build
 * order that document sets, and the reason is that every stage after
 * this one is judged by whether an abort still leaves a machine that
 * boots Windows. That cannot be judged until the thing doing the
 * aborting is known to work.
 *
 * READ-ONLY IS CHECKED HERE, NOT REMEMBERED
 *
 * Every block device this directory opens, it opens O_RDONLY. That
 * used to be true because disks.c was the only file that opened one;
 * it is not any more -- ntfs.c, fde.c and shrink.c read devices too,
 * which is what stage B is -- so the property is enforced instead of
 * arranged. build/staging greps for a writable open anywhere in this
 * directory and refuses to build the image if it finds one.
 *
 * A stage that must not write is not made safe by everyone
 * remembering. It is made safe by something that fails loudly when
 * somebody forgets.

 * hash of the GPT" is not a specification:
 *
 *   Let S be the disk's LOGICAL BLOCK SIZE in bytes, as the disk
 *   reports it -- 512 on an ordinary drive, 4096 on a 4Kn one. An LBA
 *   below means a multiple of S, per UEFI.
 *

 *     1. the first HeaderSize bytes at byte offset S (LBA 1, the
 *        primary GPT header), HeaderSize being the little-endian
 *        uint32 at offset 12 of that header, and
 *     2. NumberOfPartitionEntries x SizeOfPartitionEntry bytes
 *        starting at byte offset PartitionEntryLBA x S.
 *
 * S IS SPELLED OUT BECAUSE IT IS THE WHOLE TRAP. Linux reports a
 * partition's start and size in /sys in 512-byte units on every disk
 * including a 4Kn one, so "LBA" means one thing three lines above
 * this in stage_part and another thing here. An implementation that
 * assumed 512 would hash the wrong bytes on every 4Kn machine and
 * refuse all of them with "the way this disk is divided up has
 * changed", on disks nobody had touched.
 *
 * Not the whole of LBA 1, because the bytes past HeaderSize are
 * padding no firmware promises anything about. Not the backup table,
 * which is a separate question.
 *
 * THE BOUNDS ARE PART OF THE DEFINITION, not an implementation
 * detail: a table outside them is answered "cannot be read", which is
 * a refusal, so a second implementation that accepts more than this
 * disagrees about which machines are usable. HeaderSize in [92, S];
 * SizeOfPartitionEntry in [128, 4096]; NumberOfPartitionEntries in
