/* ntfs.h — what the Windows volume says about itself, read from Linux.
 *
 * WHY NOT ASK WINDOWS
 *
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md: "The authoritative check is not 'did Windows say
 * it shut down cleanly'. It is the on-disk NTFS state read from Linux,
 * immediately before touching anything."
 *
 * Windows' own opinion is recorded minutes earlier, on the other side
 * of a restart, by a system that may have installed updates in the
 * meantime. The bytes on the disk are the only thing that is true at
 * the moment we are about to change them.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MOUNTS ANYTHING. Every field below comes from reading
 * sectors. A mount would replay the journal, which is a write, on the
 * volume we have promised not to touch.
 *
 * THIS PARSES HOSTILE DATA. A corrupt or crafted NTFS volume is an
 * attacker-controlled input to a program running as root on somebody's
 * only copy of their photographs. Every length in the structures below
 * comes off the disk, so every one of them is bounds-checked before
 * use, and a structure that does not make sense is a refusal rather
 * than a guess.
