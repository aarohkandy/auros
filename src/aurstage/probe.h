/* probe.h — phase 7: does this computer actually work under AurOS?
 *
 * THE SINGLE MOST VALUABLE MITIGATION IN THE PRODUCT, and the reason
 * the staging environment is the initramfs rather than a second
 * reboot. docs/AURBRIDGE.md:
 *
 *   it can test WiFi, backlight, audio and suspend on the real
 *   machine before anything is committed. If WiFi will not come up,
 *   we abort and leave Windows alone -- instead of discovering it
 *   after the user has no way to reach help.
 *
 * A person whose laptop boots into a working-looking desktop with no
 * way to get online cannot search for the answer, cannot ask us, and
 * cannot get back. That is the failure this phase exists to prevent,
 * and it is worth an abort.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS AFTER THE WRITE AND BEFORE THE COMMIT. The firmware is
 * not in the initramfs -- linux-firmware is 700 MB to 1.5 GB and even
 * a WiFi-only subset is 150-400 MB, against an OEM ESP commonly 100 MB
 * and nearly full. So the probe mounts the root we have just written
 * and verified, read-only, and loads ITS modules and ITS
 * /lib/firmware. Everything at this point is still reversible: the old
 * partition table is in force, Windows still boots, and an abort here
 * costs the user nothing but time.
 *
 * "NO NETWORK" AND "NO DRIVERS AT ALL" ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS
 *
 * An adversarial review caught this and it matters. If the staging
 * initramfs and the image disagree about the kernel -- AurBridge wrote
 * last week's initramfs to the ESP and today's image is on the stick,
 * or the profile is not the one the journal named -- then
 * /probe/lib/modules/<uname -r> does not exist, every modprobe fails
 * silently, and no wireless device ever appears. Reported as a
 * hardware verdict that is "this computer's WiFi does not work", which
 * is a lie about the machine and sends the user to buy a USB adapter
 * they do not need. It is a build fault, and it says so.
