/* image.h — finding the AurOS image, and putting it on the disk.
 *
 * WHAT THE BUILD PUBLISHES, AND WHY IT IS NOT WHAT GETS WRITTEN
 *
 * build/mkimage emits a whole-disk GPT image: protective MBR, an ESP,
 * and a root partition. docs/AURBRIDGE.md has flagged for some time
 * that writing THAT into a partition embeds a nested GPT and boots
 * nothing, and offers two ways out. This is the second one: the
 * staging environment translates it, and only the root partition's
 * byte extent goes into the new root partition.
 *
 * That keeps one artifact. The thing the build boots and tests in
 * QEMU is the thing the installer copies, which is mkimage's own
 * stated reason for existing -- "a verified copy rather than an
 * unverified assembly on a stranger's machine". Publishing a bare
 * root filesystem instead would make the tested object and the
 * shipped object two different things.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES: A RAW PARTITION ON THE RECOVERY STICK
 *
 * The desktop image is over five gigabytes. FAT32 cannot hold a file
 * of 4 GiB or more, so the stick's FAT partition is out; exFAT means
 * carrying a driver in an initramfs budgeted at about 80 MB, for one
 * file; splitting it into chunks means the published artifact is
 * something you must reassemble before you can check its hash. A raw
 * partition has none of those problems and is read with one pread.
 *
 * It cannot live on C:. This environment never mounts NTFS -- there is
 * no ntfs3 in the image and boot.c says why -- and a hand-written NTFS
 * reader streaming five gigabytes is not something to put on the path
 * that decides what lands in the root partition, on a volume we have
 * just resized.
 *
 * HOW THE STICK IS FOUND: BY WHAT IS ON IT
 *
 * NOT by /sys's `removable` flag. That is the SCSI RMB bit: thumb
 * drives usually set it, but USB SSDs and anything in a USB-to-SATA
 * enclosure do not -- and a five-gigabyte payload is exactly what a
 * person puts on the big fast drive they already own. An adversarial
 * review found that the refusal this produced told the user to plug in
 * a stick that was already plugged in.
 *
 * So: every disk's partition table is scanned for a partition whose
 * type GUID is ours, and the manifest on it must name the profile the
 * journal asked for and a hash that matches.
