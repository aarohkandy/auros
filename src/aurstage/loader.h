/* loader.h — phase 8b: making the machine able to start AurOS by itself.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING, SAID PLAINLY
 *
 * Up to this file the installer shrank Windows, wrote AurOS into a new
 * partition, verified it, committed the table and handed over to it in
 * the same boot -- and nothing anywhere wrote a bootloader. The one
 * restart ended inside a working AurOS, and the next time the machine
 * was switched off it lost it: no boot entry pointed at the new
 * partition and no EFI binary existed to point at. Everything else in
 * this directory was correct and the product did not work.
 *
 * WHERE THE BOOTLOADER GOES: OUR OWN PARTITION, NEVER THEIRS
 *
 * The obvious place is the machine's EFI System partition, and it is
 * the wrong one. R12: "OEM EFI partitions hold vendor boot files and
 * firmware capsules as well as \EFI\Microsoft\Boot. Never mounted -- a
 * read-write mount is a write, and mounting is unavailable in
 * precisely the case this exists for." Mounting it read-write would
 * put the kernel's vfat driver in charge of the one partition whose
 * loss means Windows never starts again, on a machine we have
 * promised can always go back. Writing FAT structures into it by hand,
 * through wr.c, means understanding somebody else's filesystem well
 * enough to extend it -- which is a far bigger thing to be wrong about
 * than anything else in this program.
 *
 * So AurOS gets a partition of its own. plan.c was already carving one
 * out of the gap -- `rec_first`/`rec_last`, typed as an EFI System
 * partition, and until now written by nothing. UEFI boots whatever a
 * Boot#### entry points at; it does not care which EFI System
 * partition that is, and the entry names ours by its own partition
 * GUID. The machine's ESP is not opened, not mounted, and not written,
 * in this file or anywhere near it.
 *
 * WHAT GOES IN IT: THE IMAGE'S OWN ESP, COPIED WHOLE
 *
 * Not assembled. build/mkimage already builds a complete signed boot
 * chain inside the image -- Canonical's dual-signed shim, their signed
 * grub, the BOOTX64.CSV that lets shim's fallback create a real NVRAM
 * entry, and grub.cfg in the three directories that need it -- and
 * that ESP is the one QEMU boots in the build. Copying its bytes means
 * the thing that was tested is the thing on the machine, which is
 * image.h's own argument for shipping a whole-disk image rather than a
 * bare root filesystem. Assembling a second ESP here, in C, at the
 * bottom of a destructive install, would mean the artifact the build
 * proves bootable and the artifact the user gets are two different
 * objects assembled by two different programs.
 *
 * It also means this file writes no FAT. There is no directory entry
 * code here, no cluster allocator, no long-name encoder and no place
 * for any of them to be subtly wrong on a machine nobody can reach.
 *
 * BEFORE THE COMMIT, NOT AFTER
 *
 * The copy goes down while the OLD partition table is still in force,
 * into the gap the shrink made, exactly like the root filesystem. Rule
 * 4 stays true -- the layout still changes at one sector write -- and
 * a machine that loses power here is the "5-7 write and verify" row of
 * the power-loss table: NTFS smaller, old table in force, garbage in
 * free space, Windows still the default. The boot entry is written
 * afterwards, because the partition GUID it names does not exist until
 * the table does.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: MAKE AUROS THE DEFAULT
 *
 * BootOrder is untouched. Switching this machine on still reaches
 * Windows until the user has seen AurOS work and said so -- rule 3,
 * and phase 10's job, not this one's. What this file arms is BootNext,
 * which the firmware clears as it uses it: the next start reaches
 * AurOS once, and a machine that cannot start AurOS comes back to
 * Windows by itself with nobody doing anything.
