 *
 *   - Every OEM laptop made in the last decade has a WinRE recovery

 *   - This design requires a recovery USB stick to be plugged in, and
 *     a stick formatted NTFS is another candidate -- on removable
 *     media, which is now skipped outright.
 *
 * readdir() order is not disk order either: it is hash order, so the
 * answer was not even consistently wrong.
 *
 * So: the journal's win_start_lba picks it when there is a journal,
