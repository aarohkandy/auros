/* net.h — getting her onto her wifi, without a terminal.
 *
 * NetworkManager was installed, enabled and running from the very first
 * image this project produced. wireless-tools and wpasupplicant were in
 * packages_hardware next to it. Every piece of the machinery worked.
 * There was not one pixel between it and her.
 *
 * So a machine that came up connected stayed connected, and a machine
 * that came up on wifi it had never seen -- which is every machine, on
 * its first boot, in the house it was carried into -- stayed off the
 * network with no way at all to get on. The answer every other Linux
 * gives to that is `nmcli device wifi connect`, and docs/EASY.md rule 1
 * forbids it: there is no task in this product whose answer is "open a
 * terminal". Not for wifi, not as a fallback, not for advanced users.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THE BAND AND NOT IN AN ARCHETYPE
 *
 * For the same reason Help and the text size do. Six archetypes means
 * six places to forget it, and the one thing she needs before anything
 * else on the machine works cannot be the thing that is present in four
 * desktops out of six. The band is the one piece of furniture no
 * archetype owns, so this is reachable from all of them and cost none
 * of them an edit.
 *
 * WHY nmcli AND NOT D-BUS
 *
 * NetworkManager's D-Bus API is the real interface and libnm is the
 * real client, and using either would mean a new library on the image
 * and several hundred lines to reach the same four verbs: what is
 * there, what is in range, join this one, are we on. nmcli is a
 * supported, stable front end that ships with the daemon we already
 * install. We run it with execvp and a pipe -- never through a shell,
 * so a wifi name with a semicolon in it is a name and not an
 * instruction -- and read its output without blocking, because the
 * shell that paints the screen is the same thread.
 *
 * WHAT USING nmcli COSTS, SAID PLAINLY
 *
 * The password is handed to it as an argument, and an argument is
 * visible in /proc/<pid>/cmdline, which is world-readable. For the few
 * seconds the join takes, anything else running on the machine can read
 * the wifi password -- including the browser, and anything she has
 * installed.
 *
 * That is a real exposure and it is written here rather than left to be
 * found. Three things bound it. It lasts only as long as the join, not
 * the session. It happens once per network, because NetworkManager
 * keeps the password itself afterwards in a root-only file and this
 * panel never asks again for a network it has joined. And on the
 * machine this product is for, everything already runs as the same
 * person, so the browser could read her saved passwords out of her own
 * home directory with or without this.
 *
 * It is still the weaker half of the story, and the fix is to stop
 * using a command line for the one call that carries a secret: libnm's
 * AddAndActivateConnection takes it over D-Bus and never puts it in an
 * argument. That is the next change to this file, not a thing we have
 * decided is acceptable forever.
 *
 * WHAT SHE SEES, AND WHAT SHE NEVER SEES
 *
 * She sees the names printed on the back of people's routers, strongest
 * first, and a lock next to the ones that want a password. She never
 * sees SSID, WPA2, an interface name, a signal in dBm, or an error code
 * -- docs/EASY.md rule 2, enforced by tools/plainwords.sh.
