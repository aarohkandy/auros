 * renderer, the contact sheet, the harnesses -- and, on a real machine,
 * the fallback mode where the compositor could not start at all.

 * That last one is why this is here rather than private to one

/* -- the marks ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Twelve silhouettes, cut rather than outlined.
 *
 * What was here before was one recipe applied twelve times: a rounded
 * box at 20% fill with a 1.6px border and some lines inside it. At
 * 40px on a tile that reads as twelve of the same object, which is
 * exactly the generic-app-icon look the brief forbids, and it is also
 * why every archetype had to put a tinted halo disc behind one to make
 * it register at all.
 *
 * These are solid instead. Ink goes down first as a shape you could
 * recognise from across a room; the detail is then KNOCKED OUT in the
 * paper colour the caller just filled, which is how a pictogram in a
 * printed timetable works and why those survive being photocopied.
 * Nothing here needs a halo, because a solid shape on paper already
 * has contrast.
 *
 * The weights are deliberately uneven. GLOBE, MAIL and PLUS are heavy
 * masses; SETTINGS and TEXT are almost entirely rule-work; WINDOW is a
 * hollow frame where TERMINAL is a filled block, so the two that used
 * to be the same rectangle are now opposites. A set where every mark
 * weighs the same has no rhythm, and a row of them reads as wallpaper.
 *
 * Cost, since this is an Atom: the old ICON_GLOBE stamped roughly 105
 * overlapping anti-aliased discs for its ring and another 100 for its
 * meridians, per draw, because draw.h had no stroked-arc primitive.
 * This one is a disc and four spans.

 * nothing on screen could be important without also being coloured.
 * The second is that font_size_sm, font_size_lg and line_height were
 * in the theme schema, in the template, and in every .theme file, and
 * NOTHING READ THEM -- the scale was three multipliers hardcoded here.
 * A theme author who edited font_size_lg got nothing at all.
 *
 * So: the display face supplies huge/big/dmid, the text face supplies
 * small/tiny, and the text face's BOLD cut supplies mid/label. The
 * display steps are multiples of font_size_lg and the text steps are
 * font_size and font_size_sm, so all three keys are now load-bearing
 * and a theme can retune the whole scale without a recompile.
