/* foot.h — the band that is always there.
 *
 * docs/EASY.md rules 3, 6 and 7: she can always make the text bigger,
 * every state she can reach she can leave, and help is one thing in one
 * place. All three want the same thing -- something that does not
 * belong to any archetype and cannot be navigated away from -- so all
 * three live here.
 *
 * It carries exactly what she had no way to do at all:
 *
 *   Help          one thing, same place, in all six archetypes
 *   Settings      the brightness, the sound, the clock, and which of
 *                 the six desktops this machine uses -- every one of
 *                 which was decided when the image was built, by
 *                 somebody else, for everybody
 *   Internet      her wifi. NetworkManager was installed and running
 *                 from the first image and there was not one pixel
 *                 between it and her, so a machine that came up off
 *                 the network stayed off it -- and docs/EASY.md rule 1
 *                 forbids the answer every other Linux gives, which is
 *                 to open a terminal
 *   Smaller / Bigger   the type scale, which is the single highest
 *                 value control in the product for a 68-year-old
 *   Turn off      there was no way to shut the computer down except
 *                 holding the power button in
 *
 * HOW IT REACHES SIX ARCHETYPES WITHOUT SIX IMPLEMENTATIONS
 *
 * It does not draw into them and they cannot draw into it. The host
 * hands the archetype a surface that is shorter than the screen --
 * same pixels, same stride, fewer rows -- and reduces c->screen_h to
 * match. Every primitive in draw.c and font.c already clips to s->h, so
 * the band is unreachable from a layout by construction rather than by
 * agreement, and not one archetype needed editing to gain it.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE A THEME DOES NOT REACH
 *
 * Its colours are fixed, and that is a deliberate exception to the rule
 * in docs/DESIGN.md that nothing hardcodes a colour. A theme may
 * restyle every pixel in this product except the one that leads out of
 * it: the control she uses when the screen has become unreadable must
 * not be styled by the thing that made it unreadable.
 *
 * Its type has a floor for the same reason. The floor is a floor and
 * not a ceiling -- the band grows with her chosen size, because the
 * person who picks the largest text is the person who needs the way out
 * in the largest text.

 * way back, and no way to do the other two things a person wants from
 * that corner of a computer: start it again, and put it to sleep.
 *
 * docs/EASY.md rule 6 says every state she can reach she can leave,
 * and "off" is the one state that rule cannot reach into afterwards.
