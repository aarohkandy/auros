/* layouts/dock.c — the "Favourites along the edge" archetype.
 *
 * A fixed strip of the programs you actually use sits at the bottom
 * edge, in one order that never changes, whether they are running or
 * not. The thing you want is always in the same spot, so reaching it
 * stops being a decision and becomes a reflex. Everything else you find
 * by typing its name. Windows overlap and can be dragged around.
 *
 * The distinction this archetype exists to make: a taskbar lists what
 * is OPEN, a dock lists what you USE. "Which of my favourites" and
 * "which of my windows" are different questions, and people have strong
 * preferences about which one they want to be asked. So nothing here is
 * allowed to reorder: no most-recent-first, no grouping, no sliding
 * cells under the pointer. Position is the entire value of the thing;
 * anything that moves an icon spends the only currency this design has.
 *
 * The honest cost is written on the tin: a program that is open but not
 * a favourite has nowhere of its own to live. See dock_slots().

 * be a cosmetic bug.
 *
 * Order: the finder, then every pinned app in the order the app list
 * declares them, then any app that is running but NOT pinned.
 *
 * That last group is the compromise. Those windows have to be reachable
 * from somewhere — a program you opened once and cannot find again is
 * the worst failure a desktop has — but giving them permanent dock
 * positions would turn the dock into a taskbar, which is the one thing
 * it must not become. So they are appended after a divider: present,
 * clearly not favourites, and the only part of the strip that is
 * allowed to move. They vanish when closed, and if the user wants one
 * to stop moving they pin it, which is the same gesture as "this is a
 * favourite now". A user who lives in unpinned windows is telling us
 * they wanted the taskbar archetype.

/* ── what a key types ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The real session fills c->key_text from the keymap the machine is
 * actually configured with, which is the only way a capital letter, a
 * character that needs Shift, or a keyboard that is not American ever
 * produces the right thing. shell_key_char() is the fallback for the
 * builds with no keymap behind them -- the preview renderer, the
 * contact sheet, the harnesses -- so the archetype still works when it
 * is being drawn rather than run.
 *
 * It lives in shellcommon.c because it stopped being this archetype's
 * business: the wifi panel needs the same answer, and on a machine
 * whose compositor failed to start, a password field that accepts no
 * characters is the difference between a repairable machine and a
 * brick. A private static in one layout is not a place to keep that.
 *
 * This file's first version had ONLY the table, under a comment saying
 * a real session got characters from the keymap, and no such path
 * existed: every machine in the world typed lowercase unshifted QWERTY
 * and a password with a capital in it could not be entered.
