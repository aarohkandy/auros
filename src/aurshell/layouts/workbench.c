/* layouts/workbench.c — the "Panes and keyboard" archetype.
 *
 * Windows never overlap. They divide the screen between them, so
 * everything open is visible at once, and you move between them with
 * the keyboard. Six workspaces sit behind the six number keys.
 *
 * This is the one archetype allowed to require learning, and the
 * chooser says so plainly so that nobody picks it by accident. What it
 * is NOT allowed to do is the thing real tiling window managers do on
 * first launch: hand someone a blank screen and no way to discover what
 * any key does. That is an inherited defect, not an inherent one, so
 * there is one small hint strip along the bottom which the user
 * dismisses once. It reserves its own band rather than floating over a
 * pane, because "nothing ever overlaps" is the whole promise here and
 * our own UI is the worst possible place to make an exception.
 *
 * Nothing else is softened. There is no dock, no home screen, no
 * minimise, and the mouse does almost nothing.

 * area, and index order runs top-left to bottom-right.
 *
 * Master/stack was the other candidate and it is the more famous
 * model, but a fixed master fraction starves the stack: at seven
 * windows on a 16:9 screen the stack columns come out barely two
 * hundred pixels wide, which is the sliver problem the whole archetype
 * is supposed to avoid. The BSP has no fixed fraction to starve: over
 * one through sixteen panes on a 1600x900 screen the narrowest pane it
 * produces is 1:2.58 and the widest 3.01:1, both shapes you can
 * actually read a document in. Promoting a pane is still available; it
 * just swaps into slot 0 (top-left) rather than into a privileged
 * region, since with equal areas there is no master to promote into.
 *
 * Each split subtracts one gap and gives the remainder to the second
 * child, so the parts always sum back to exactly the parent: no
 * rounding crack between panes, no unfilled strip at the edge.
 */
/* MASTER_BIAS applies to the FIRST cut only. A BSP of exactly equal
 * halves produces a screen with no first pane and no second — every
 * region the same size, every boundary on a midline, which is the
 * tiler equivalent of centring everything. One biased cut at the top
 * of the tree gives the work you are actually doing a visibly larger
 * region and leaves the rest of the recursion untouched, so it does

 * But an archetype in which an application can never be started is not

 * furniture: it exists only when there is nothing else, which is
 * exactly when the question "what could go here" is the only question
 * on screen. The moment a window exists it is gone.

 * hit-testing, per docs/SHELLS.md. */
