/* layouts/tiles.c — the "One thing at a time" archetype.
 *
 * Boot lands on a page of large labelled buttons. Press one and it grows
 * into the whole screen. A single Home control, always in the same place
 * along the bottom, brings the page back. Nothing overlaps, nothing
 * minimises, nothing is ever hidden behind anything else.
 *
 * The point: for someone whose only computer is a phone, "a desktop" is
 * a second thing to learn before they can do the first thing — windows
 * that move, stack, shrink to an icon and reappear somewhere else. This
 * archetype asks them to learn nothing: it is a phone home screen at
 * desk size, and it behaves the way their thumb already expects.
 *
 * The cost is on the tin in tiles.shell and is real: you cannot see two
 * things at once, and switching goes via Home. What it buys is a
 * guarantee no other archetype here can make — there is exactly ONE
 * control for moving around, it is always drawn, it is always in the
 * same pixels, and nothing can ever cover it. Every other way of getting
 * lost needs a second place for things to be. This has no second place.
