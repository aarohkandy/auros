/* settings.h — the things about this computer she is allowed to change.
 *
 * There was no settings screen in this product. Not a thin one: none.
 * The wallpaper, the theme, the clock, the keyboard, and which of the
 * six desktops the machine uses were all decided when the image was
 * built, by somebody else, for everybody. docs/SHELLS.md calls the
 * choice of desktop "the single most consequential line" in a profile
 * and then offered her no way to reach it.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * Only things she would go looking for, and only things that are hers
 * to decide. Not the network -- that has its own button, because
 * getting online is not a setting, it is a thing you do. Not the
 * permissions or the app lock-down, which belong to whoever set the
 * machine up. This is the brightness, the sound, the size of the
 * words, what the time is, how the desktop works and what it looks
 * like.
 *
 * A build can forbid all of it. allow_settings_change="no" takes the
 * button away entirely rather than showing controls that refuse, which
 * is the rule this product keeps relearning: a control that looks like
 * a control and is not is worse than no control.
 *
 * THE SLIDERS
 *
 * Every one of them has a minus and a plus as well as a track, and the
 * track answers a single press anywhere along it. Dragging works and
 * is never required -- docs/EASY.md rule 5. A slider that can only be
 * dragged is a control for steady hands.
