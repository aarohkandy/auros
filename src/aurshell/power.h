/* power.h — the battery, the backlight, and how loud it is.
 *
 * The three things a laptop cannot be used without, and the three this
 * product had no answer for at all. Not a missing button: a missing
 * everything. There was no package, no code and no pixel between a
 * person and the brightness of the screen they were looking at.
 *
 * WHY THIS READS /sys DIRECTLY
 *
 * Because the kernel already publishes all of it as files. upower is
 * a daemon, a D-Bus connection and a dependency to learn the same two
 * numbers that are sitting in /sys/class/power_supply, and it can be
 * absent or not running. A file that is either there or not is a
 * failure mode with one case in it.
 *
 * Sound is the exception and goes through wpctl, because there is no
 * file for it: the volume a person means is the one the sound server
 * applies, not the hardware mixer underneath it, and only the sound
 * server knows that number.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS ALLOWED TO BE ABSENT
 *
 * A desktop computer has no battery and usually no backlight. A
 * machine with no sound card has no volume. Every reader below says so
 * plainly rather than returning a zero that reads like "empty" or
 * "silent", because "this computer has no battery" and "this battery
 * is flat" are not the same sentence and must never be shown as one.
