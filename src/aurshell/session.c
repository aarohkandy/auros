/* session.c — the join between the compositor and the shell.
 *
 * aurwl knows about clients, buffers and protocol objects. The shell
 * knows about archetypes, icons and what the user meant by a click.
 * Neither should learn the other's vocabulary, so this file is the only
 * place that speaks both, and it is deliberately small: a window list
 * to reconcile, a pointer and a keyboard to route, and popups to paint
 * on top.
 *
 * The one genuinely interesting decision here is how a click finds its
 * way into a window. The shell does not ask the archetype where it drew
 * the window -- it reads the record the scaled blit left behind while
 * painting it (anim.c's tracker). Painting and hit-testing therefore
 * cannot disagree, because the second one reads the first one's
 * output rather than a second opinion about it.
