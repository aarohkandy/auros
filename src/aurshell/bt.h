/* bt.h — her headphones, her mouse, her keyboard.
 *
 * The same problem the wifi had, one layer along. A laptop's pointing
 * device, its headphones and increasingly its keyboard are Bluetooth,
 * and a machine that cannot pair one is a machine somebody has to go
 * and find a cable for. There was no Bluetooth stack on the image at
 * all, and therefore nothing to put a panel in front of.
 *
 * It is deliberately built to the same shape as src/aurshell/net.c --
 * a band button, a list of things in range, press one, a sentence when
 * it does not work -- because they are the same act to her: "connect
 * this computer to that thing". Two panels that do the same kind of
 * job and behave differently are two things to learn.
 *
 * WHY bluetoothctl AND NOT THE D-BUS API
 *
 * Same answer as nmcli's, for the same reasons: BlueZ's real interface
 * is D-Bus and using it means a library, a connection and several
 * hundred lines to reach four verbs. bluetoothctl ships with the
 * daemon we install. It is run with execvp and a pipe, never through a
 * shell -- a speaker called `;rm -rf ~` is a name somebody chose, and
 * it arrives here as bytes.
 *
 * WHAT PAIRING COSTS HER
 *
 * Nothing to type, in the ordinary case. Most headphones and mice pair
 * with no code at all; the ones that want a number are answered with
 * the agent's default, which is what every phone does. A device that
 * genuinely needs a person to compare two numbers is told plainly that
 * it cannot be paired from here, rather than being pretended at.
