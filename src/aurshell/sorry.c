/* sorry.c — what she sees when the desktop does not start.
 *
 * Until this existed, aurshell.service said
 *
 *     OnFailure=getty@tty1.service
 *
 * and a comment above it explaining that this was better than leaving
 * the user with a black screen and no way in. It was better. It was
 * also a login prompt, on a machine whose owner has never been told
 * the account name, has never been told the password, and whose
 * password the image expires on purpose so that it cannot be used even
 * by someone who guesses it. docs/EASY.md rule 1: there is no task in
 * this product whose answer is "open a terminal". A black screen and a
 * console she cannot use are the same screen to her.
 *
 * So this is what she gets instead: one sentence about what happened,
 * one about what the machine is doing, one about what she can do. No
 * buttons, because rule 5 says nothing may require a gesture and
 * because a program that runs when the desktop has failed should not
 * also depend on reading her mouse. The unit restarts the desktop when
 * this exits, which is what makes "it will try again" true rather than
 * consoling.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN PROGRAM
 *
 * Because aurshell is the thing that just failed. Running it again to
 * apologise for itself works only in the cases where it would have
 * worked anyway. This links three files -- the mode-setter, the
 * rasterizer and the font engine -- and does nothing else: no policy,
 * no theme parsing, no application scan, no compositor, no input. The
 * fewer things it needs, the more of the failures it can survive to
 * describe.
 *
 * It deliberately hardcodes its two colours, for the same reason the
 * band in foot.c does: the screen that explains a failure must not be
 * styled by a file that may be what failed.
