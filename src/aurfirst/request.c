/* request.c — reading the one word the desktop is allowed to ask for.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS C AND NOT THREE LINES OF SHELL, which is what it was.
 *
 * The desktop runs as the person using the machine. It asks for
 * something by creating a file in aurshell's own runtime directory --
 * mode 0700, owned by her -- and a systemd path unit runs the answer
 * as root. The argument for that arrangement over a setuid binary is
 * written in auros-answer.path and it is a good argument, and the
 * first implementation of it was strictly worse than the thing it
 * rejected.
 *
 * SHE OWNS THAT DIRECTORY, SO SHE DECIDES WHAT EVERY NAME IN IT IS.
 * The shell version did `head -c 64 "$REQ"`, `: > "$RES.new"`,
 * `>> "$RES.new"` and `chmod 0644 "$RES.new"` -- as root, through
 * paths she controls, with no O_NOFOLLOW anywhere. An adversarial
 * review reproduced all four primitives:
 *
 *   ln -s /etc/shadow /run/auros/answer.result.new   -> truncated,
 *      appended to, and chmod 0644, by root, from one request.
 *   ln -s <a root-only file> /run/auros/answer       -> the first 64
 *      bytes of it, filtered, echoed back into a file she can read.
 *
 * That is a local root escalation on every built image, reachable by
 * anything running as her -- a compromised browser tab is enough.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than a longer list of checks:
 *
 *   ROOT NEVER OPENS A PATH SHE OWNS FOR WRITING. Every answer, log
 *   and report is written into /run/auros-answer, which is the
 *   answering service's own RuntimeDirectory: root-owned, mode 0755,
 *   world-readable. The desktop reads from there.
 *
 *   THE ONE PATH ROOT DOES READ IS OPENED O_NOFOLLOW, and then
 *   fstat()ed on the descriptor it will actually read -- not stat()ed
 *   on the name, which is a race she wins by swapping the file
 *   afterwards. A symlink is not followed, a directory is not read, a
 *   FIFO does not block us, and what is removed is removed by
 *   unlinkat on the same directory descriptor.
 *
 * And the word is still not a command: it is matched against a fixed
 * list by the caller, and anything else is reported as unknown without
 * being echoed anywhere she could not already read.
