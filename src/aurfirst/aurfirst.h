/* aurfirst.h — phases 9 and 10: the machine stops being on loan.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SITS
 *
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md's phase model ends with two phases nothing
 * implemented:
 *
 *    9  FIRSTBOOT   desktop; user confirms "this works"
 *   10  IMPORT      Ferry imports files; optionally make AurOS default
 *
 * Everything before them is written and tested. The installer leaves a
 * machine that has AurOS on it, has a signed boot chain in a partition
 * of its own, has a Boot#### entry pointing at that partition, and has
 * BootNext armed at it -- and has BootOrder untouched, so switching it
 * on still reaches Windows. That is rule 3: nothing irreversible until
 * AurOS has booted and the user has said it works.
 *
 * This is the program that lets her say it.
 *
 * THE HOLD, AND WHY IT IS NOT A ONE-OFF
 *
 * BootNext is consumed by the firmware as it is used. The installer
 * arms it at the end of the install and then hands over to AurOS in the
 * SAME boot, so it is still armed when the machine is next switched
 * off -- but exactly once. If somebody uses AurOS, shuts down, starts
 * up (BootNext fires, AurOS), shuts down and starts up again, the
 * second start has nothing armed and reaches Windows.
 *
 * So `aurfirst hold` re-arms it on every boot until the question is
 * answered. The machine keeps coming back to AurOS while AurOS works,
 * and the moment it does not the firmware falls through to BootOrder,
 * which still says Windows, and nobody has to do anything. That
 * property is the whole of R4's answer and it is worth paying one
 * NVRAM write per boot for.
 *
 * THE ONLY PLACE THAT WRITES BootOrder
 *
 * src/aurstage/nvram.h says, at length, that the staging environment
 * may not write BootOrder and that there is deliberately no function
 * there that does -- because the way a rule like that gets broken is
 * somebody finding a function that already does the thing. The rule was
 * never "this product may not write BootOrder"; it was "not until the
 * user has seen AurOS work and said so". This program is what "and said
 * so" means, and `aurfirst confirm` is the one function in the tree
 * that writes it.
 *
 * It is a separate program with a separate copy of about a hundred
 * lines of efivarfs plumbing, and that duplication is deliberate rather
 * than an oversight. The alternative is one shared writer that both can
 * call, which is precisely the function the staging environment must
 * not have. Two programs with different rules about what they may write
 * do not share the thing the rules are about. tools/aurfirsttest.sh
 * pins the one thing they DO share -- the on-disk shape of an efivarfs
 * variable -- against the other implementation's bytes.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IMPORTS ANYTHING. Ferry is a complete set of tools
 * already, installed at /usr/lib/ferry, and it mounts Windows
 * read-only and refuses a dirty volume out loud. This program decides
 * WHEN it is allowed to run -- which is after the answer, never before
 * -- and gets out of the way.

 *  -1  cannot tell: unreadable, truncated, or too short to be one
 *
 * A load option's first four bytes are its attributes, and the UEFI
 * spec is explicit about two of them: an entry without
 * LOAD_OPTION_ACTIVE is not to be booted, and one with
 * LOAD_OPTION_HIDDEN is not even to be shown. A third, the category
 * field, separates a boot option from an APPLICATION -- a firmware
 * setup entry, a vendor's diagnostics -- which the boot manager is not
 * supposed to run in the ordinary sequence at all.
 *
 * This matters in exactly one place: a machine whose firmware ships
 * with no BootOrder and enumerates for itself. af_confirm() builds one
 * there, and building it in plain numeric order would put the
 * manufacturer's diagnostics partition ahead of Windows -- something
 * nobody asked for, which she would then have to undo in a firmware
 * menu she was told she would never have to open.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS AND NOT TWO, and that distinction is the whole safety
 * of this. The first version returned 0 for "no" and for "I could not
 * read it" alike, and af_confirm DROPPED everything that answered 0.
 * A review built the machine that breaks: firmware with no BootOrder
 * -- which is firmware that has already shown it does not keep the
 * boot variables tidy -- and a Windows entry with LOAD_OPTION_ACTIVE
 * clear, which is how several vendors record "the user switched this
 * off in the boot menu" rather than deleting the variable. Windows
 * was filtered out, a BootOrder containing only AurOS was written,
 * confirm printed success and stamped the answer permanently, and
 * af_decline then refused to undo it because ours was the only entry
 * left. The way back was gone, and the program had removed it while
 * saying the opposite.
 *
 * So nothing is dropped any more; see af_confirm. This answer only
 * decides ORDER, and -1 is ordered with the yeses, because "I could
 * not read it" is not evidence against an entry. */
