 * There was a bilinear resample here, run on every commit, to turn the

 * with it.
 *
 * It was the whole of a denial of service. The destination was any
 * positive int32, so six requests -- set_destination(16384, 16384) and
 * a one-pixel buffer -- allocated a gibibyte and spent nine seconds
 * inside a single dispatch, with nothing painted and no key or click
 * answered anywhere on the desktop, for as long as the client cared to
 * keep committing. Clamping the destination to the output helped and
 * was not enough: a one-pixel buffer stretched to the screen is still
 * a full pass over every pixel of it, on every commit, for ever.
 *
 * And it was wasted even when honest. The shell fits a window's
 * content into whatever rectangle the archetype gave it -- that is one
 * scale, already. Resampling first meant every viewport client was
 * scaled twice, losing quality both times, and paying a fresh
 * allocate-and-free of the whole surface on every frame.
 *
 * What a destination actually says is "this surface's LOGICAL size is
 * N by M". That is a fact about layout and about where the pointer is,
 * not about pixels, so it is recorded as one and costs nothing. */
