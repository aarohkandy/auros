/* aurwl.h — the Wayland server AurOS runs applications on.
 *
 * Until this existed, every window on an AurOS desktop was a picture of
 * a window. The shell painted a title bar, a body and a shadow, and
 * nothing was behind it, because there was no way for another process
 * to hand us pixels. A desktop that cannot run a browser is not a
 * desktop.
 *
 * WHY A WAYLAND SERVER AND NOT X11
 *   We already own the two hard ends of the pipeline: kms.c scans out,
 *   and the shell reads evdev. What was missing was only the middle --
 *   a protocol by which another process gives us a buffer and receives
 *   input. That is exactly what Wayland is. Taking X11 instead would
 *   mean adopting Xorg, its drivers and a window manager: millions of
 *   lines to solve a problem we had already solved at both ends, and an
 *   input and output model the rest of the world is leaving.
 *
 * WHY libwayland-server AND NOT wlroots
 *   wlroots would replace kms.c and our evdev handling -- the two
 *   pieces most specifically ours, and the two that make the shell come
 *   up on a 2013 laptop with no GPU driver worth the name. It would
 *   also pin us to its API breaks. libwayland-server is not a framework
 *   in that sense: it is the reference implementation of the wire
 *   format and object lifetimes, the way libc is the reference
 *   implementation of write(2). We take the wire, we keep the policy.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHELL STILL OWNS
 *   Everything visible. aurwl never draws. It hands the shell a
 *   `surface *` per window -- the same CPU pixel buffer type draw.c has
 *   always composited -- and takes back geometry and input. The six
 *   archetypes did not have to change to gain real windows, which is
 *   the test of whether the seam was in the right place.
