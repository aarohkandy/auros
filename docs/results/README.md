# What actually ran

These are transcripts, not claims. Each is the output of the named
tool on the commit that added it here, kept so that a later reader can
see what "green" meant rather than take somebody's word for it.

| file | what it is | run it yourself |
|---|---|---|
| `roundtrip.txt` | install AurOS on a synthetic machine, start it, put Windows back from the stick, put it back again from the copy on the computer with no stick, refuse a damaged copy. 37 checks. | `sudo sh tools/installtest.sh` |
| `nostick.txt` | the no-stick mode: AurBridge's phase engine arms the machine with the image inside its NTFS volume; the staging environment installs with one disk and nothing else plugged in, keeps the way back on the disk, puts Windows back from it; both refusals leave the disk byte-for-byte unchanged; and the restart from firmware with Secure Boot on goes through shim and grub, with the disk's serial deliberately reported differently on each side; and the choices from the personalize page are on the EFI partition for first boot. Under Secure Boot it also proves the kernel was locked down and the NTFS module, raw writes and EFI variable writes still worked; that nothing is written outside `\EFI\AurOS` and a real Ubuntu's `grub.cfg` on the same partition is left alone; and, on two firmwares made from Microsoft's db with keys taken out (Secured-core; 2023 keys only), that the firmware refuses shim and AurBridge refuses first, with the right card, having written nothing. 45 checks. | `sudo sh tools/nosticktest.sh` |
| `choicesboot.txt` | the real desktop image, started from firmware for the first time with a `choices.conf` on a second disk's EFI partition: it comes up Spanish (the locale generated, not just named), with a Spanish keyboard from Windows' KLID, Paris time from Windows' zone name, the Moss look and the taskbar desktop, all recorded so Ferry leaves them alone. 9 checks. | `sudo sh tools/choicesboottest.sh` |
| `firstboot.txt` | the real v4 desktop image under OVMF with NVRAM that persists: it asks "does this work?", yes makes AurOS the default, no sends the next start to Windows and nothing re-arms, and -- case C -- with a second entry called AurOS in the menu it takes its own, by the partition it names. 32 checks. | `sudo sh tools/firstboottest.sh desktop` |
| `putback.txt` | "Put Windows back", from the button in the real v4 image with Secure Boot on: the word as the desktop user, `answer.sh` in its real sandbox, a restart, AurOS's own menu taking the restore entry, grub starting the staging kernel with `aurstage.restore`, and the next start AurOS again. 16 checks. | `sudo sh tools/putbacktest.sh` |
| `bootchain.txt` | `rootfs/usr/lib/auros/bootchain`, what an installed AurOS runs as `update-grub` and `grub-install`: the menu (newest kernel, fallback by number, Put Windows back kept), and every refusal in front of AurOS's EFI partition, each with a fixture that hits it -- a forged shim carrying Microsoft's real CA, Microsoft's signature grafted onto a changed program, a non-CA intermediate, dbx and vendor-dbx entries, SBAT levels -- and each run again with its check removed, where it must stop refusing. 72 checks. | `sh tools/bootchaintest.sh` |
| `bootupdate.txt` | the real v4 image under OVMF with Secure Boot, one shim behind, through a real `dpkg -i` of shim-signed, grub-efi-amd64-signed and grub2-common, then `apt-get install --reinstall` with the postinsts' trigger moved away, then a new kernel through its own hook: the new shim installed by each path alone, after finding and judging the Put Windows back kernel on a second disk; BootOrder untouched; the next start through the new shim into the new kernel; a damaged kernel, and grub falls back by itself. 27 checks. | `sudo sh tools/bootupdatetest.sh` |
| `screen.txt` | the staging screen (`src/aurscreen`): its step sentences are still the ones `install.c` says, its states on transcripts, its pictures at four sizes. 24 checks. | `sh tools/screentest.sh` |
| `loader.txt` | **with the power off and the stick out, does it come back up in AurOS?** Install, then start the machine from firmware with no `-kernel` and no memory stick — and then again on `OVMF_CODE_4M.ms.fd` with Microsoft's keys enrolled and Secure Boot enforcing. Also: the machine's own EFI partition, byte for byte, unchanged. 17 checks. | `sudo sh tools/loadertest.sh` |
| `powercut.txt` | the power goes at each of seventeen named instants — twelve during the install, five during the restore — and Windows comes back with every file byte-identical. 138 checks. | `sudo AURSTAGE_FAULT=1 ./build/staging && sudo sh tools/powercuttest.sh` |
| `matrix.txt` | ten shapes of computer through the dry run, which writes nothing: 4Kn, an OEM gigabyte EFI partition, a first partition at LBA 34, MBR, BIOS, BitLocker, a hibernated Windows, two Windows volumes, no room. | `sudo sh tools/matrixtest.sh` |
| `images.md`, `*.json` | the five profile images, their digests, and what each one cost to build. | `sudo ./build/all` |
| `build-all.txt` | the transcript of the run that made them, interrupted twice by bugs it found in forge and resumed both times. | |

## What these do not prove

Written here rather than left for somebody to discover.

**One firmware.** OVMF is not an Insyde H2O from 2014, and firmware
variety is the one thing on this list that cannot be synthesised at
all. The mitigation is the dry run: it writes nothing, prints one
machine-readable line, and is worth shipping on its own to build a
hardware matrix before anyone's disk is at risk.

**One virtual disk.** A real drive that lies about having flushed is a
property of that drive. What the power-cut matrix tests is the ORDER
writes reach the device and that each commit is one sector, which is
the property the design rests on.

**Nothing about a real power supply**, a failing cell, or a laptop
whose battery disconnects under load. R6's answer to those is the AC
gate and the refusal on battery, not this.

**The Windows half is not in any of these** -- it is in
`.github/workflows/windows.yml`, which starts the installer on a real
Windows VM on every push; see its runs on GitHub. What follows is why
it cannot be here. `src/aurbridge/plat_win.c`
cannot run here — there is no Windows, and wine has no raw disk
handles, no volume dismount and no firmware variables. What is tested
is the phase engine above it, against a computer made of files
(`plat_sim.c`), and the bytes it produces against the programs that
read them (`tools/bridgetest.sh`). `plat_win.c` meets a real machine
for the first time on the first machine it meets.

That now includes the download. `plat_fetch` exists twice — WinHTTP on
Windows, hand-written HTTP in the simulation — and only the second one
is exercised, by `tools/exetest.sh` against a server it starts itself.
What the test covers is the logic the two share and the part that
actually goes wrong: a server that ignores `Range` and answers 200
where a 206 was asked for. What it does not cover is WinHTTP.

**Nothing here has been on a network that allows Firefox.** This
builder's egress policy answers `403` for every Mozilla and Launchpad
host, so the three routes `build/forge` now tries are all unexercised
and the five images in `images.md` ship Epiphany. The build refuses to
substitute quietly now, which is the check that was missing when they
were made — but a refusal is not the same as a Firefox.
