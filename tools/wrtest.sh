#  wrtest — the one file in src/aurstage that is allowed to write
#
#  Two things are being tested and only one of them is the code.
#
#  The code: a write outside its named window must be REFUSED, not
#  clamped. A clamped write is a write that went somewhere else and
#  said nothing.
#
#  The arrangement: build/staging must refuse to build an image in
#  which any file OTHER than wr.c opens a device writably. That gate is
#  what makes wr.c worth having -- not the bounds checks, which anybody
#  can write, but the fact that there is nowhere else to write from.
