#  powercuttest — the risk register's two worst entries, made to happen
#
#  R4 says: a single-PC household whose install goes wrong has no
#  second computer and no way to make a stick. R6 says: a power cut in
#  the window where the disk is inconsistent. Every other test in this
#  tree asks whether the installer works. This one asks the only
#  question that decides whether it may be given to anybody:
#
#      IF THE POWER GOES AT THIS EXACT INSTANT, CAN SHE GET WINDOWS
#      BACK, WITH EVERY FILE IN IT UNCHANGED?
#
#  It is asked once per named dangerous instant in the installer, and
#  once per named dangerous instant in the restore -- which is the more
#  important half, because a machine running the restore is already a
#  machine something has gone wrong with, and it is where a second
#  failure is likeliest.
#
#  HOW THE CUT IS MADE, and why not with a cord and a stopwatch.
#
#  Killing a virtual machine from outside at a wall-clock moment lands
#  on a different instruction every run: a pass proves nothing about
#  the instant you cared about and a failure cannot be reproduced. So
#  the installer names its own dangerous instants (see fault.h) and a
#  fault-injection build can be told to stop dead at exactly one of
#  them. Every run is the same run.
#
#  WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, said plainly:
#
#    - A disk's own write cache. QEMU's is not a Seagate's. What is
#      tested here is the ORDER writes reach the device and that each
#      commit is one sector, which is the property the design rests on;
#      whether a particular drive lies about having flushed is a
#      property of that drive.
#    - One firmware. OVMF is not an Insyde H2O from 2014.
#    - One geometry. tools/matrixtest.sh varies that.
