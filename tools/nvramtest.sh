#  nvramtest — the one file that may write an EFI variable
#
#  Two things, and only one of them is the code.
#
#  The code: a boot entry is a wire format that firmware reads and
#  nothing on the machine ever reads back. If it is wrong, the symptom
#  is a computer that starts nothing, with no error message, and the
#  product's own logs saying the entry was written successfully. So
#  the bytes are decoded here by a SECOND implementation, in another
#  language -- tools/efivarstore.py, which the end-to-end test uses to
#  read real OVMF NVRAM -- rather than compared against the constants
#  that produced them.
#
#  The arrangement: build/staging must refuse to build an image in
#  which nvram.c has stopped being what it says it is. It is allowed
#  the writable open every other file is refused, and pays for it with
#  four checks; a gate that has never fired is a gate nobody should
#  trust, so each of them is made to fire here.
#
#    sh tools/nvramtest.sh
