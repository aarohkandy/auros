#  nosticktest — the whole install with NO memory stick at all
#
#  installtest.sh proves the product as designed: a stick holds the
#  image, the installer's notes and the first copy of the way back.
#  This proves the no-stick mode, where none of that exists:
#
#    - AurBridge's own phase engine (the simulation, out/aurbridge-sim)
#      runs in no-stick mode against this machine and writes the
#      manifest and the journal. Nothing here writes them by hand.
#    - The image and its manifest go into \AurOS\ on the NTFS Windows
#      volume, where the wizard puts them.
#    - The staging environment boots with ONE disk and nothing else
#      plugged in, reads the image through a read-only mount, keeps the
#      way back in memory until the shrink has made room, writes it
#      there first, installs, and hands over.
#
#  Then: every file in Windows (the AurOS folder included) is what it
#  was; the way back is on the disk; and putting Windows back from it,
#  still with no stick, gives back the machine we started with.
#
#  And the refusals, each with the disk byte-for-byte unchanged -- which
#  is also the proof that the read-only mount of Windows wrote nothing.
