/* powertest.c — does this computer know its own battery and screen?
 *
 * Every laptop this product exists to rescue has a battery and a
 * backlight. No build host does. So the machines are made out of
 * directories: the kernel publishes all of it as small files, and a
 * tree of small files is a laptop as far as this code is concerned.
 *
 * The cases are the ones that are wrong on real hardware:
 *
 *   two batteries        a laptop with a second cell reports two of
 *                        everything, and one number has to come out
 *   full on the mains    "plugged in" and "charging" are not the same
 *                        sentence, and a full battery that says it is
 *                        charging is a small lie she will notice
 *   a battery bay with   present=0 reports zero everywhere, which read
 *   nothing in it        as a flat battery would put 0% on the screen
 *                        of a machine that has none
 *   acpi_video0          laptops expose a real panel control AND the
 *                        firmware's seven-step version of it, and on
 *                        many machines the firmware one does nothing.
 *                        Picking it is how a brightness slider moves
 *                        and changes nothing.
 *   a panel that counts  one counts to 7 and another to 96000, so the
 *   to 7                 control cannot be built on the raw number
 *
