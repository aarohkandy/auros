# plainwords.sh — does this product talk to her in words she uses?
#
# docs/EASY.md rule 2: "Every user-facing word is one she uses." A word
# she does not use is a word that stops her, and the person this product
# is for stops rather than experiments.
#
# That rule is easy to agree with and easy to forget at four in the
# morning, so this checks it. It reads the strings the product actually
# puts on a screen and fails if any of them contains a word from the
# list in docs/EASY.md.
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS AT, and what it deliberately does not:
#
#   shell_text*(...)        every string the shell paints
#   shells/*.shell          the sentences shown when choosing an
#                           archetype at install time
#   profiles/*.profile      brand_name and profile_description
#   src/aurbridge/wizard.c  the Windows-side wizard's own words
#
# It does NOT look at fprintf(stderr, ...). Developer output is allowed
# to say "compositor" and "stride" and "DRM master", because the person
# reading it is a person who can act on it. Mixing the two lists is how
# a rule like this becomes unenforceable and gets ignored.
#
# It is a grep, not a compiler. It will miss a string assembled at
# runtime, and it cannot tell a comment from code in every case. A miss
# is a bug in this file, not a licence.
#
#   sh tools/plainwords.sh
#
# Exit 0 if every user-facing string is plain, 1 otherwise.
set -u
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

# The list is docs/EASY.md's, verbatim. Adding a word here is free.
# Removing one requires changing docs/EASY.md and saying why, because
# the list is the rule and this file is only its enforcement.

# ── 1. Strings the shell paints ─────────────────────────────────────

# this did exactly that, reported ok, and could not fail: almost every
# call in this codebase wraps, so the string sits on the NEXT line from
# the function name and was never looked at. A check that cannot fail is
# worse than no check, because it is also a claim.
#
# So: every string literal in the shell, filtered down to the ones that
# look like PROSE -- something with a space in it that is not a path, a
# format string, a theme key or a comment. Lines that write to stderr
# are developer output and are skipped.
