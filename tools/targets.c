/* targets.c — is everything she has to press big enough to press?
 *
 * docs/EASY.md rule 4: every interactive element is at least 44 pixels
 * on its shorter side AT 1024x600, the bottom of the range, because
 * that is where the old machines are. A target measured at 1920x1080
 * and allowed to shrink with the panel is a target that fails exactly
 * where it matters.
 *
 * The rule caught its own author within an hour of being written. The
 * always-present band at the bottom of the screen -- the one piece of
 * furniture in this product that exists specifically for a person whose
 * hands are not steady -- was sized at 46 pixels tall and then had
 * padding taken out of it, leaving 27-pixel buttons. Nobody had to be
 * careless for that to happen; the two numbers were three lines apart.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE
 *
 * It measures the controls that publish their geometry: the band's
 * buttons, through foot_buttons(), and every screen of the wifi panel,
 * through net_targets(). Archetype internals -- a dock cell, a window
 * close button, a rail row -- do not publish theirs, so they are not
 * measured here and this harness says so rather than implying coverage
 * it does not have. Exposing that geometry is how they get covered,
 * and the reason to expose it is this file.
 *
 * The wifi panel is measured the way it is BECAUSE of this file. Its
 * layout takes a view -- which screen, how many networks -- rather
 * than reading the live state, so every one of its five screens can be
 * asked about here without a radio, a daemon or a person pressing
 * things. A geometry function that can only be asked about the state
 * the machine happens to be in is a geometry function nothing can
 * check.
