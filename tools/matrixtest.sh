#  matrixtest — the hardware we cannot buy, built out of QEMU
#
#  This product will meet ten-year-old laptops with firmware nobody
#  has a copy of and disk layouts no current tool produces. We have
#  one machine. So the machines are synthesised: the geometries and
#  layouts that the risk register says break installers, each one
#  built, booted, and asked the one question the dry run exists to
#  answer -- WOULD YOU TOUCH THIS COMPUTER?
#
#  Every row here is a real failure mode from docs/research/red-team.md
#  or from a bug this tree has already had:
#
#    4Kn            /sys reports partition starts in 512-byte units on
#                   every disk, including one whose blocks are 4096.
#                   Confusing the two makes every partition eight
#                   times too small. It is the single most expensive
#                   arithmetic mistake available here.
#    a 1 GiB ESP    OEM EFI partitions are not 100 MiB. The saved copy
#                   of the startup is sized from this, and a constant
#                   would be wrong on most real laptops.
#    LBA 34         Disks partitioned before 2010 do not start the
#                   first partition at 1 MiB. A recovery tool that
#                   restores "the first 2048 sectors" destroys them.
#    MBR, BIOS      Unconditional refusals. The one-restart design
#                   rests on an EFI variable; a machine with none has
#                   no safe way to fail.
#    BitLocker      THE MUST NOT.
#    hibernated     A session is still in there; resizing loses it.
#    two Windows    Every OEM laptop has a WinRE partition, so "more
#                   than one NTFS" is the norm, not a corner case.
#
#  It uses the DRY RUN, which writes nothing, so the whole matrix can
#  be run on a laptop without risk and without a spare disk.

# ── building a machine ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# SECTOR SIZE IS A PROPERTY OF THE LOOP DEVICE, not of the file. sgdisk
# on a plain file always writes a table in 512-byte LBAs, so a 4Kn
# machine cannot be made by partitioning the file directly -- it has to
# go through a loop device opened with --sector-size 4096, which is
# also the only way to find out whether our own reader gets it right.
# HOW BIG THESE MACHINES ARE, and why it is not arbitrary.
#
# Every `could-convert` row asks whether a SHAPE is convertible --
# sector size, ESP size, where the first partition starts. The shape is
# the claim; the capacity is not. But the installer answers one
# question, and it includes "does AurOS fit", so a fixture too small to
# hold AurOS makes the row demand a `yes` that would be a lie.
#
# That is what happened. Windows was 1024 MiB, of which about 1018 is
# reclaimable, and at `aurstage.min_gb=1` an install needs that
# gigabyte PLUS the 512 MiB partition AurOS starts from PLUS a copy of
# this machine's own ESP: a little over 1.6 GB. Four rows went red and
# the installer was right every time.
#
# 4096 MiB of Windows on an 8 GiB disk leaves about 4 GiB reclaimable,
# which clears that by more than a factor of two -- so the rows go back
# to testing geometry, which is what they are for, and a future floor
# would have to more than double before they are about capacity again.
# The files are sparse; the disk this builds on does not feel the
# difference.
