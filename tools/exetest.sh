#  exetest — one file somebody double-clicks
#
#  The product is a download. For a long time it was three downloads
#  that had to end up in the same folder, and the message a person got
#  for not knowing that was "the copy of AurOS to install could not be
#  found" -- a true sentence about a mistake we made.
#
#  Two things now make it one file, and both of them are the kind that
#  fail silently:
#
#    the staging environment lives INSIDE the executable, as a PE
#    resource. Whether it is really in there is a question about the
#    resource directory, and it is answered here by a second
#    implementation in python that does not ask the program that wrote
#    it. A resource that is present and truncated boots nothing.
#
#    the image is fetched, and RESUMED. What goes wrong with a resume
#    is not the resume: it is a server that ignores the Range header,
#    answers 200 with the whole file where a 206 was asked for, and
#    gets its first byte written four gigabytes into the file. That
#    server is every misconfigured CDN edge, and the failure it makes
#    is a five gigabyte download that hashes wrong after forty minutes
#    with nothing to say about why.
