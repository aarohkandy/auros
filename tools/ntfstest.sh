#  ntfstest — does src/aurstage/ntfs.c read a real volume correctly,
#  and does it refuse the three states that must stop a conversion?
#
#  WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM stagetest.sh
#
#  stagetest boots the whole staging environment in QEMU, which is the
#  right test for "does it come up and leave the disk alone" and a
#  slow, coarse one for "does the parser get this field right". This
#  runs the same parser against a dozen deliberately broken volumes in
#  a few seconds, so the broken volumes can be specific.
#
#  EVERY FIXTURE IS BUILT BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE PARSER. The
#  dirty flag is set by ntfsfix, the hibernation file is written
#  through ntfs-3g, the log pages are laid out from the documented
#  offsets. A fixture built with our own reader would agree with our
#  own reader about a volume that is wrong in the same way twice.

# flags -- which is how the clean case is known to be read right.)
