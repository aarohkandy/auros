#  screentest — does the staging screen say where the install is?
#
#  src/aurscreen paints the one restart from the lines aurstage says.
#  It finds the seven steps by the sentence that starts each, so the
#  check that matters most is that those sentences are still in
#  src/aurstage/install.c, word for word: reword one there and the
#  screen would sit on the step before it for the rest of the install,
#  with nothing failing anywhere.
#
#  Then, off-screen (--state, --png), on transcripts:
#    an install part way           the right step, the bar, the warning
#    an install that finished      every step done, no warning
#    a refusal                     "was not installed", in red, verdict kept
#    a restore                     its own title, no install steps
#    garbage on the pipe           no crash
#  and, if a serial log from a real run is given, that it ends handed
#  over with every step reached.
