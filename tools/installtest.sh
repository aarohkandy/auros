#  installtest — the whole thing, on a synthetic machine
#
#  Everything else in tools/ tests a part. This boots the staging
#  environment on a machine shaped like the ones this product is for,
#  with a real NTFS Windows volume with real files in it and a
#  recovery stick, and lets it INSTALL -- shrink, write, verify,
#  probe, commit, grow, hand over.
#
#  Then it asks the questions that matter:
#
#    - did the installed system actually start?
#    - is every file in Windows still exactly what it was?
#    - is Windows' partition still bootable, and smaller?
#    - does another tool agree the new table is valid?
#
#  And for every refusal case: is the disk byte-for-byte unchanged?
#
#    sudo sh tools/installtest.sh
