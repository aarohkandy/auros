#  gpttest — the partition table, read and written back
#
#  src/aurstage/gpt.c produces the single most dangerous write in this
#  product: one sector, LBA 1, after which the machine's idea of where
#  its partitions are has changed. A wrong CRC there does not produce
#  an error message. It produces firmware that quietly falls back to
#  the backup table, or refuses the disk, on a machine that is now
#  three thousand miles away.
#
#  THE TEST THAT MATTERS is the round trip: read a real GPT made by
#  somebody else's tool, serialise it back, and require the bytes to be
#  identical. Nothing else proves the writer and the reader agree with
#  the world rather than merely with each other.
