#  firstboottest — does the real AurOS ask, and does the answer stick?
#
#  Phases 9 and 10 are the only part of this product that decides what
#  the computer starts FOR GOOD. Until somebody says AurOS works, every
#  power-on must reach Windows unless AurOS has been asked for once
#  more; the moment they say it works, AurOS becomes the default and
#  Windows stays in the menu; the moment they say it does not, the next
#  power-on reaches Windows and nothing ever re-arms.
#
#  Every one of those sentences was, until this test, true only of a
#  unit test: aurfirsttest drives aurfirst against a directory that
#  pretends to be efivarfs, and welcometest drives the panel against a
#  directory that pretends to be /run. Neither is the real thing.
#  installtest and loadertest boot the real INSTALLER, but the system
#  they hand over to is a 334 MiB ext4 whose init prints one line --
#  enough to prove the boot chain, and not a single systemd unit.
#
#  This one boots the REAL image -- out/auros-<profile>.img.zst, the
#  artifact build/all publishes, byte for byte what AurBridge writes --
#  under OVMF with NVRAM that persists between boots, in the state an
#  install leaves the firmware in:
#
#      Boot0000  "Windows Boot Manager"   first in BootOrder
#      Boot0002  "AurOS"                  HD(ESP)/\EFI\AurOS\shimx64.efi
#      BootNext  0002                     the one restart
#
#  and then reads, after every boot, the two things that cannot lie
#  about it: OVMF's own serial console, which names each entry it tries
#  and the one it STARTS, and the variable store the next boot will
#  read.
#
#  WHAT IS NOT REAL, AND WHY. One thing in the booted system is not
#  AurOS: a unit that stands in for a person pressing one button. It
#  writes one word into /run/auros/answer, as the desktop user, with
#  O_EXCL and mode 0600 -- exactly what src/aurshell/welcome.c does --
#  and then powers the machine off. Everything from that file onwards
#  is the product: auros-answer.path, answer.sh running as root,
#  aurfirst reading the request through O_NOFOLLOW, BootOrder, the
#  stamp. The panel's own drawing and hit-testing are welcometest's.
#
#  WHAT IS NOT PROVEN: a real firmware, which will not print what it
#  did and may reorder or prune the boot menu in ways OVMF does not.

# ═══ C. two entries called AurOS ═══════════════════════════════════════
#
# The firmware menu can hold two entries called AurOS, and the ordinary
# way it comes to is: try AurOS, say no, put Windows back, try again.
# "Put Windows back" leaves the old entry behind; the new install adds
# its own with a higher number. Taken by description, the old one wins:
# the hold re-arms BootNext to it and confirming puts it first.
#
# WHY THE OTHER ENTRY POINTS AT A PARTITION THAT EXISTS. The first
# version of this case planted an entry for a partition that had been
# deleted, which is exactly what "Put Windows back" leaves -- and OVMF
# replaced it at the next boot with one of its own under the same
# number, so three checks below passed with no dead entry left to be
# mistaken for ours. (Why: see where Boot0001 is planted below. It was
# never about the partition; an entry no BootOrder or BootNext mentions
# is a free number to EDK2.) A test that passes because the firmware
# tidied up is not testing anything.
#
# So the other AurOS is on a SECOND DISK, in a real AUROS-BOOT with a
# file where its entry says: valid by every rule OVMF has, and the other
# realistic way to have two. aurfirst has to choose by which disk holds
# /, and a rule that takes the first one called AurOS takes that one.
