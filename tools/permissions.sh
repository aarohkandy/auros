# permissions.sh — can this computer do the things it offers to do?
#
# Four times now the same bug: the product puts a control on the
# screen, the control runs something, and the permission service
# refuses it in silence.
#
#   the Internet button   found by reading the code
#   Turn off, and opening a USB stick   found by an adversarial review,
#                                       three lines away in the same file
#   installing a downloaded .deb        found by reading gdebi's own
#                                       policy while checking the second
#   Let it sleep          found by an adversarial review of the commit
#                         that ADDED the button -- it relied on the
#                         distribution's allow_active and nothing
#                         granted it
#
# Every one of them looked right. Every one of them pressed cleanly.
# None of them did anything, and nothing anywhere said so -- not the
# build, not the journal, not the screen. A control that looks like a
# control and is not is the specific failure this product cannot
# afford, because the person it is for does not try twice.
#
# WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE
#
# It reads a built rootfs. It can see what is INSTALLED and what is
# WRITTEN DOWN: which polkit actions exist, which our rule grants,
# which groups the account is in, which groups the unit demands.
#
# It CANNOT see a running system. In particular it cannot see whether
# the desktop's logind session is active, which is what every
# `allow_active` in the distribution's own policies depends on -- and
# "there is no session at all" was the original bug here. So section 5
# checks the things that MAKE it active, statically, and the smoke
# test on a booted image checks the rest.
#
